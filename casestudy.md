# Case study: DIY biofertilizers effects on crops

## Abstract

This report aims to evaluate the effects of using a simple "do it yourself" (DIY) biofertilizer in vegetable production and gardening.

Enabling vegetable producers and gardeners to manufacture their fertilizer input makes their operation more resilient to supply chain problems and rising prices of fertilizers.

In the experiment, we measure the performance of a biofertilizer that is easy to manufacture at home or on-farm, then we compare it to a sterilized version (control) of the same substance in the context of vegetable production and urban gardening.

Three small-scale vegetable producers conducted the trials for this case study, and soil samples, leaf samples, and crop samples were sent for laboratory analysis. On top of that, the producers measured BRIX throughout the growing season to monitor plant health.

Apart from these analyses, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the vegetable producers. Gardeners from an urban gardening company, who also trialed the biofertilizer, are included in the interview.

From the laboratory test results, we could not conclude decisive effects on plant health or crop.

The study is made possible with the funding of _Leader Södra Bohuslän_[[3][LSB]] and _Jordbruksverket_[[4][JBV]].

## Introduction

A biofertilizer is: "... a substance which contains living micro-organisms which, when applied to seeds, plant surfaces, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant ... add nutrients through the natural processes of nitrogen fixation, solubilizing phosphorus, and stimulating plant growth through the synthesis of growth-promoting substances. The micro-organisms in biofertilizers restore the soil's natural nutrient cycle and build soil organic matter. Through the use of biofertilizers, healthy plants can be grown, while enhancing the sustainability and the health of the soil." [[1][BIOF]]

Enabling producers, farmers and gardeners to manufacture their fertilizers on-premise gives their operation higher resilience, cuts costs, and allows them to tailor the inputs to their specific needs, setting, and context.

_Gerry Gillespie_ provides the recipe for the biofertilizer evaluated in this case study and offers it freely on his website. [[2][RECIPE]]

The biofertilizer is easy to manufacture at home or on-farm, requiring only jars, a bucket with a lid, a fermentation lock, and commonly available ingredients (such as rice, milk, and yeast) from the supermarket. Optional ingredients like basalt rock powder, seaweed meal, and manure may be less accessible but are not required. The recipe steps are simple and easy to follow.

Three local vegetable producers (introduced below) conducted experiments to evaluate the effects of the biofertilizer on plant health and crop quality.

During the growing season, laboratories conducted several tests (soil analysis, leaf analysis, and crop analysis). Apart from that, the producers also measured BRIX.

"The foundational idea is that the refractive index (BRIX) of plant sap correlates to the content of dissolved solids, including sugars, and can be used as an overall assessment of plant health." [[3][JKEMPF]]

Measuring BRIX is easy with a refractometer and can be done in the field; a test takes seconds or minutes to complete. The higher the reading, the better plant performance and health. Unfortunately, it only hints at plant health, and one can not make conclusions (like specific nutrient deficiencies) based on its reading.

A common problem when conducting case studies is environmental factors (like water, deficiencies/excess nutrients) that play in. Therefore, the trial compares two beds (experiment and control) in close vicinity with similar conditions.

On top of that, many decisions in vegetable production and gardening come from previous experiences and gut feelings. To capture these intangible dimensions of the trial, interviews with producers and an urban gardening company (which also tested the biofertilizer) was done.

### The vegetable producers

The producers in this experiment are all small-scale vegetable producer that grows ecological food on their land. They use sustainable farming practices and do not rely on heavy machinery or equipment. Instead, they rely on hand tools and natural fertilizers to grow a diverse range of vegetables on their 800-1200 m². These producers sell most of their ecologically-grown food directly to customers and local businesses or farm stands.

They manage their lands with ideas from _conservation agriculture_[[4][CA]], such as minimizing soil disturbance and maintaining permanent soil cover.

The producers operate on the west coast of Sweden, in Kungälv, Stenungssund, and Ljungskile (20-60 km north of Gothenburg).

The case study was performed in their market gardens.

#### Timmervikens skafferi

_Timmervikens skafferi_ operates approximately 800 square meters of beds and passages, as well as 250 square meters of greenhouses. The main fertilizer inputs used for growing are horse manure and lucern pellets, and the farm has recently increased its use of cover crops with plans to continue doing so in the future. To control caterpillars of the "large white" (Pieris brassicae), inputs with _Bacillus Thurengensis_ inoculants are used[[5][BT]]. Ferric Phosphate pellets are used to control slugs (Arion vulgaris)[[6][SLUG]].

The farm practices no-till/no-dig management methods[[7][NOTILL]] and actively promotes the soil microbiology.

#### Branseröds gård

_Branseröds gård_ operates on 15 x 10 square meters of beds, as well as an additional 100 square meters for growing crops like potatoes and corn. On top of that, they have 168 square meters of greenhouse beds.

Fertilizer inputs are sourced on-farm from cows, sheep, and goats, specifically using cow deep bedding in their greenhouse beds.

To control caterpillars of the Large White, they use _Bacillus Thurengensis_ inoculants once a year.

Management methods originates in no-till/no-dig [[7][NOTILL]]

Instead of tilling or cultivating the beds, they use a broad fork to aerate the beds before the growing season and cover the beds with plastic during the winter.

The tests were conducted in the greenhouse, which had relatively poor tomato conditions. The growing medium is semi-decomposed animal bedding (cow).

Remark: the experiment bed had possibly a bit better conditions that the test bed.

### Gardeners from Bee Urban

Bee Urban[[8][BU]] is a company based in Stockholm, Sweden that specializes in the design, construction, and maintenance of urban gardens that provide habitats for insects, animals, and birds, while also providing recreational areas for humans. They typically create meadow-like environments, often on rooftops, using specific species of flowers that are beneficial for bumble bees, solitary bees, and other insects.

Their clients are typically larger businesses, municipalities, and organizations. As of the time of this report, they have ten gardens in the Stockholm area and have tested the biofertilizer on one of them.

## Method

### Experiment setup

The three vegetable producers set up two tomato green house beds with similar conditions, including sun exposure, soil type, and water availability. Both beds were planted with the same variety of tomatoes.

Each producer received two jars, one containing the biofertilizer and the other serving as the control substance. The jars were labeled to keep them separate, and instructions on how to prepare, apply, and measure BRIX were also provided.

The substances were diluted at a ratio of 1:150 before application, which was done using a handheld low-pressure sprayer as a foliar spray. Applications were conducted either early in the morning or late in the evening, as per the instructions. The producers randomly assigned one jar to one bed and the other jar to the other bed.

The first application of biofertilizer was made to the roots of the tomatoes before planting. Approximately every second week throughout the growing season, additional applications were made.

### Prepation of substances

Instructions for preparing the biofertilizer used in the experiment are available in [[2][RECIPE]]. In our experiment, we used a version without any manure, as requested by the producers. Instead, we used LAB Serum, which the recipe indicates is a suitable replacement. Instructions for making LAB serum are also available in [[2][RECIPE]].

The biofertilizer used in this experiment included seaweed meal (marked as optional in the recipe) and excluded rock phosphate powder (also marked as optional).

The control substance was sterilized by boiling the biofertilizer for two minutes.

The two substances were then placed into sterilized jars, which were marked with a code. The meaning of the code was recorded, but not disclosed to the producers.

### Tests

Throughout the case study, samples were taken from the experiment and control bed and sent to laboratory for analysis (expect for the _spring soil sample_ were only one sample was taken).

The samples were taken at the same time and packed and deliviered as prescibed by the laboratory.

Overall, the following tests were performed:

- Soil analysis in early spring (before the growing season started),
- Leaf for analysis (samples were sent when fruit started ripening)
- Tomato analysis for measuring lycopene levels and vitamin C (considered to be quality indicators of tomatoes)
- Soil analysis in late autumn (after the growing season ended)

On top of that BRIX was measured and recorded before and after every application of the substances with a few hours apart.

The reports from the analyses can be found in the appendix of this report.

Each test is explained in more detail below.

#### Soil analysis

To understand the effects of the inputs on soil quality, each producer conducted a soil test in the early season (May) and two additional tests in the control and experimental beds during the late season (December). The spring test reports provide a baseline measurement of the chemical composition of the soil before any inputs were applied, while the late season tests reveal the potential impacts of the inputs on the soil's chemical composition over the course of the growing season.

The Spurway method was used for the soil tests, which provide information on the availability of nutrients in the soil. The laboratory results were categorized as "low", "pretty low", "good", "pretty high", or "high".

The spring sample was collected from only one of the beds. The autumn samples was collected from both experiment and control beds.

#### Leaf analysis

Leaf analysis is a method of evaluating the nutrient content of plant leaves. It is often used to assess the overall health and nutritional status of a plant, as well as to diagnose nutrient deficiencies or imbalances that may be affecting plant growth and development.

Leaf analysis can be useful in identifying nutrient deficiencies that may not be apparent through other methods, such as soil testing, and can help guide the application of fertilizers or other nutrients to ensure that plants are receiving adequate nutrition.

The method can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of fertilization programs and to identify potential problems with plant nutrition that may be impacting crop yields.

The leaf samples were collected when the tomatoes started to ripen.

#### Tomato analysis

Lycopene and vitamin C are important nutrients found in tomatoes and are often used as indicators of tomato quality.

Lycopene is a pigment that gives tomatoes their red color and is a powerful antioxidant. It has been linked to several health benefits, including reducing the risk of certain types of cancer[[9][MEDSCPC]] and heart disease[[10][NIHGOV1]], and may also have anti-aging and skin-protecting effects.

Vitamin C is an essential nutrient to maintain a healthy immune system and is also an antioxidant. In addition, it plays a role in the synthesis of collagen, which helps to keep skin and connective tissue strong, and may also help to reduce the risk of certain types of cancer[[11][NIHGOV2]] and heart disease[[12][NIHGOV3]].

In general, tomatoes higher in lycopene and vitamin C are considered to be of higher quality, as they may provide a greater range of health benefits to consumers.

In hindsight, testing for lycopene is not an ideal measurement for comparing tomatoes [[13][LVTOM]], since it closely relates on the ripeness of the tomato. However, since the tomatoes were harvested by the producers at the same time, and considered to have reached a similar level of ripeness, the results are still interesting in this study.

#### BRIX analysis

BRIX, or degrees Brix (°Bx), is a measurement of sugar content in a plant. It is often used as an indicator of plant health because sugar plays a vital role in plant growth and development.

High levels of sugar can indicate that a plant is receiving sufficient nutrients and light, while low levels may suggest that the plant is experiencing stress or is not getting enough nutrients.

A small sample of plant sap was extracted (with a garlic press) from the plant leafs and then measured with a digital refractometer.  

BRIX was measured before and a couple of hours after application of the biofertilizer.

Measurements started after the plants had reached a certain size, where removing leaves would no longer negatively affect the plant's development.

### Interviews with the producers and gardeners

We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with the three vegetable producers and a number of urban gardeners to capture the hard-to-measure aspects of their experiences using the biofertilizer. The interviews were conducted over the phone or via video chat and were semi-structured, allowing for flexibility and in-depth exploration of the participants' experiences.

The questions and answers can be found in the appendix, providing insight into the participants' thoughts and feelings about using the biofertilizer. These interviews provide valuable information that complements the findings of the experimental study, particularly concerning the more intangible aspects of using the biofertilizer.

The same questions was used for the producers. For the gardeners a different set of questions used.

## Result

The case study was unable to differentiate between the control and experimental beds in terms of the selected indicators in the study.

This lack of correlation between inputs (such as fertilizers, water, and other amendments) and the resulting soil analysis is not uncommon, as many factors can play in. These factors include deficiencies in water or nutrients, environmental factors such as temperature and sunlight, and the presence of adequate levels of nutrients in the soil.

Despite the lack of correlation in this case, diagrams are provided in the following section to visualize the differences between the control and experimental beds.

The reports from laboratories are included in the appendix.

#### Comments on Soil tests

It is challenging to determine the specific effects of the inputs on the soil based on the observed differences between the experiment and control beds. While some variations were observed between the two beds in the laboratory's categorization of the results, the overall categorization remained largely unchanged from the spring to the late season tests.

#### Result: Leaf analysis

Due to miscommunication. _Timmervikens skafferi_ and _Branseröds gård_ used the same test, while _Vävra Köksträdgård_ used a different one.

Despite these differences, the results were still similar enough to be considered relevant for this case study. It is important to note that the use of different tests and laboratories may affect the reliability of the results and should be taken into consideration when interpreting the data.

The results of the leaf analysis tests were categorized as "low", "pretty low", "good", "pretty high", or "high". However, for Timmervikens skafferi and Branseröd Gård, only the categories of "low", "good", and "high" were applicable. These values are shown in tables in the following section.

#### Comments on Leaf analysis

While some differences between the control and experiment beds were observed in the data, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about the impact of the inputs on tomato plants. For example, at _Branseröds gård_, the experiment bed showed more values classified as "good" compared to the control bed. However, this pattern is not consistently observed across all producers or beds.

Overall, the data provides some insights into the effects of the inputs on tomato plants, but further research and analysis will likely be needed to more fully understand the impact of the input.

#### Fruit analysis

It should be stressed that one can not compare the results between the producers as these values are, among other things, dependent on variety.

#### Comments on Tomato tests

The results for lycopene and vitamin C levels among the producers were mixed.

For one producer, the experiment bed had higher levels of both nutrients, while for another producer, the experiment bed had lower levels for both nutrients. The third producer showed the another pattern, with higher levels of vitamin C in the experiment bed but lower levels of lycopene.

Overall, the data does not support any clear conclusions about the potential effects of the biofertilizer.

Further analysis and research may be needed to better understand the relationship between inputs and tomato quality.

Worth noting is a the levels of vitamin C in these tomatoes are 30%-230% higher compared to the "standard tomato" from _Livsmedelsverket's Livsmedelsdatabasen_ (National Food Administration, Sweden - Food database) [[14][LVLD]].

#### Results: BRIX analysis

The producers found it challenging to get consistent readings, as two samples from the same plant could produce different results. As a result, the plant sap was strained through cloth before the measurements was recorded.

#### Comments on BRIX readings

The problem of getting consistent BRIX readings, raises concerns about the reliability of these measurements presented. If a similar study is to be done in the future, one needs to find ways to increase the reliability of BRIX readings.

These result provide no strong evidence to suggest that the biofertilizer had a significant impact on the plants in this study.

### Discussion

#### Experiment/Case study

Despite analyzing various aspects of soil and plant health, this study was unable to draw any conclusions about the impact of using this biofertilizer on the health of the producers' tomato plants and tomatoes.

This may be due to the complex and varied environmental factors that can influence plant health, such as nutrient deficiencies and water availability. It is challenging to isolate the specific effects of the biofertilizer in this context.

Another related reason for not being able to measure effects of the bio-stimulating properties of the experiment substance, could be that the producers already have a microbiologically rich soil. All of them use methodoliges that both protects and promotes the microbiology.
