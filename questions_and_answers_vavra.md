# Questions and answers from Timmervikens skafferi

## Application of biofertilizer

* Did you see any differences with regards to growth, vigor, taste, diseases?
  * No, not really - nothing to make any conclusions from. Some plants were bigger, and others were smaller, but that is how it usually is.
* Any other differences?
  * No
* Describe your experiences from applications of the substance
  * It was easy to both prepare and distribute the substances.
* Did you understand which one was control and not?
  * Yes, one of them popped a bit when opening the jar. As a consequence of this, the substances were prepared by someone else to avoid unconsciously compromising the experiment.
* What type of inputs do you use?
  * Lucern pellets, algae extracts, Epsom salt, potassium magnesia
* Did you adjust other inputs as a consequence of the use of the biofertilizer?
  * No, the recommended [from soil analysis recommendation - Ed.] amount of inputs/amendments was used in all beds.
* Anything else you wish to bring forward when it comes to the substance?
  * No

## Measuring BRIX

* What are your thoughts on measuring BRIX?
  * Measuring BRIX consistently was more complicated than expected. One got readings with significant deviations from the same plants a few seconds apart.
* Did you measure any differences between the two beds?
  * Yes, there were differences, but no consistent differences and nothing to make conclusions from. It all felt very random.
* Did it provide yourself with any valuable insights?
  * No
* Have you previously measured BRIX?
  * Not within the context of gardening
* Will you continue to measure BRIX?
  * Maybe. Measuring BRIX from the crops and put forward as a selling-point could be interesting.
  
## Soil analysis

* Anything that suprised you from the soil analysis results?
  * Not really, done previously and got approx same result.
* Will you change your process/inputs/etc as a result of the soil analysis?
  * No, not from these soil tests, but follows recommendations from previous soil tests regarding fertilizers and other inputs.
* Will you do more soil analysis in the future?
  * Yes, most likely.
  
## Leaf analysis

* Anything that suprised you from the leaf analysis results?
  * No
* Will you change your process/inputs/etc as a result of the leaf analysis?
  * No
* Will you do more leaf analysis in the future?
  * No, probably not.
  
## Crop analysis

* Anything that suprised you from the crop analysis results?
  * Surprisingly high lycopene levels compared to the other producers.
* Will you do more crop analysis in the future?
  * Probably not, it was fun to do it for this case study, but it is too expensive to do it just for fun.

## Other

* Anything else you wish to bring up?
  * No
