# Questions

## Application of biofertilizer

* Did you see any differences with regards to growth, vigor, diseases?
  * We ran a few simple trials comparing bokashi, worm compost, and the biofertilizer. The results indicate that the biofertilizer performed at least as well as bokashi and worm compost. However, to make solid conclusions about the effects, we would have to design an experiment more carefully, using control and test beds, the same crops, etc.
* Any other differences?
  * No
* Describe your experiences from applications of the substance
  * We experienced no problems. There are a few differences from other liquid amendments, and the smell was all right.
* What type of inputs do you use?
  * Bokashi, worm compost, bone meal, basalt rock dust, biochar and organic pesticides.
* Did you adjust other inputs as a consequence of the use of the biofertilizer?
  * We did not use any other fertilizer or amendments. The biofertilizer seems sufficient.
* Anything else you wish to bring forward when it comes to the biofertilizer?
  * It would have been nice to try to measure more, like the microbial activity, crop nutrient density, and how it affects soil fungi and mycorrhiza, amongst other things.
