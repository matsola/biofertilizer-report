# Questions and awsers from Branseröd Gård

## Application of biofertilizer

* Did you see any differences with regards to growth, vigor, taste, diseases?
  * The tomatoes was more good looking in the experiment bed. The plants produced a lot more tomatoes (estimates 300%), the plants were healthier and bigger.
* Any other differences?
  * The control bed had issues with blossom-end rot[[1][BER]], but not in the experiment bed. Lost a few plants in the control bed, but none in the experiment bed.
* Describe your experiences from applications of the substance
  * During the application of the substances, no problems were encountered. The low-pressure sprayer made the process easy. On average, 1 liter of substance was prepared for every 20 plants, although in some cases, this amount was not sufficient to fully cover all plants, depending on the thoroughness of the application. (For the leaf analysis, leaves was selected in a way that they had received sprays everytime).
* Did you understand which one was control and not?
  * Was able to guess from the smell. The control substance did not smell "living". There were some color differences also.
* What type of inputs do you use?
  * None. The beds had sufficient nutrients (judging from the soil tests)
* Did you adjust other inputs as a consequence of the use of the biofertilizer?
  * No
* Anything else you wish to bring forward when it comes to the substance?
  * No

## Measuring BRIX

* What are your thoughts on measuring BRIX?
  * It was interesting but hard to interpret. In hindsight, I should have measured more plants. Later in the season, I started measuring the leaves only, which was easier.
* Did you measure any differences between the two beds?
  * There was no clear distinction between the two beds.
* Did it provide yourself with any valuable insights?
  * Not really, but it was interesting.
* Have you previously measured BRIX?
  * No
* Will you continue to measure BRIX?
  * Yes, will test it on more crops the coming season.
  
## Soil analysis

* Anything that suprised you from the soil analysis results?
  * The analysis showed "extreme" values, both very high and very low. Which caused some concern, but in the end, the tomatoes were gorgeous and full of flavor.
* Will you change the your process/your inputs/etc as a result of the soil analysis?
  * Intend to contact the lab for further suggestions. Has started broad-forking the beds to see how that affects future soil tests.
* Will you do more soil analysis in the future?
  * Yes, see previous question.

## Leaf analysis

* Anything that suprised you from the leaf analysis results?
  * The leaf analysis mirrored the look and feel of the plants regarding vigor and plant health.
* Will you change the your process/your inputs/etc as a result of the leaf analysis?
  * Same as with the soil samples.
* Will you do more leaf analysis in the future?
  * Overly expensive. Considers the soil test to be a good enough test.

## Crop analysis

* Anything that suprised you from the crop analysis results?
  * Surprisingly, the control had marginally higher numbers, even though the tomato plants looked worse and had a lower yield.
* Will you do more crop analysis in the future?
  * No.

## Other

* Anything else you wish to bring up?
  * Nothing at the moment.
