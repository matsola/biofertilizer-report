# Case study: DIY biofertilizers effects on tomato

## Abstract

In this experiment we measure the performance of a simple, do-it-yourself (DIY), biofertilizer comparing it to a sterilized version (control) of the same substance in a tomato garden.

Three tomato growers setup the two beds each (with similar conditions and tomato variaties) and applied the solutions as a foilar spray every second week.

During the season a series of tests and analysises was performed:

- soil analysis before the growing season and after the growing season ended,
- leaf analysis (once during the experiment),
- measure BRIX (once every second week),
- measure vitamin C and lycopene to indicate the fruit quality

## Introduction

A biofertilizer is: "... a substance which contains living micro-organisms which, when applied to seeds, plant surfaces, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofertilizer]

In this case study, we try to measure the difference between a biofertilizer versus a sterilized version of the same substance (control); this, in turn, indicates if the biology in the solution makes a difference.

The biofertilizer evaluated in this study is very simple to manufacture at home or on-farm, requiring a jar, bucket with a lid, and a fermentation lock. Ingredients (like rice, milk, and yeast) are commonly available at a supermarket. Some optional ingredients might not be as accessible depending on setting, like basalt rock powder, seaweed meal, and manure. The recipe is available in [https://www.gerrygillespie.net/uploads/4/5/6/5/45656863/bioferments_biostimulants_and_biofertilisers_-_making_them_on-farm_fact_sheet_final_metric_march_2019.pdf]

In the study, three local vegetable growers were tasked with setting up two separate beds with similar conditions regarding soil, sun, water, and tomato varieties. On top of that, they were instructed how to prepare the solutions, apply them, and measure BRIX readings.

"The foundational idea is that the refractive index (BRIX) of plant sap correlates to the content of dissolved solids, including sugars, and can be used as an overall assessment of plant health."[https://johnkempf.com/the-challenges-of-managing-nutrition-with-brix-readings/]

Unfortunately, measuring BRIX does not tell the whole story and is why soil, leaf, and fruit samples were sent to laboratories for chemical analysis.

In the wake of corona and the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, synthetic fertilizer prices have sky-rocketed. Before the conflict, fertilizers were also a considerable expense for many farmers and growers. Some of which could probably be made on-farm with a bit of time and effort from the grower. 

In later years, with the regenerative agriculture movement, farmers have shifted their use of synthetic fertilizers for more natural ways of growing food. They are trying to mimic nature and tap into the powers of biology in, on, and around plants. Soil biology and soil health are pivotal concepts in regenerative agriculture, and a whole market of different living amendments has shown up.
