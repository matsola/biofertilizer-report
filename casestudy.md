# Case study: DIY biofertilizers effects on crops

## Abstract

This report consists of two parts. The first part, referred to as "the experiment" or "the case study," attempts to measure the effects of biofertilizers in a market garden setting. The second part attempts to capture the experience of using biofertilizer.

In the experiment, we measure the performance of a simple do-it-yourself (DIY) biofertilizer, comparing it to a sterilized version (control) of the same substance in a tomato garden.

Three tomato producers set up the two beds each (with similar conditions and tomato varieties) and applied the solutions as a foliar spray every second week.

During the season, a series of tests and analyses was performed:

- soil analysis before the growing season and after the growing season ended,
- leaf analysis (once during the experiment),
- measure BRIX (once every second week),
- measure vitamin C and lycopene to indicate the fruit quality

The second part, focusing on the experience of using the solution, was conducted with in-depth interviews with the tomato producers and urban gardeners to capture their experience using the solution.

The study is made possible with the funding of _Leader Södra Bohuslän_[[3][LSB]] and _Jordbruksverket_[[4][JBV]].

## Introduction

A biofertilizer is: "... a substance which contains living micro-organisms which, when applied to seeds, plant surfaces, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant ... add nutrients through the natural processes of nitrogen fixation, solubilizing phosphorus, and stimulating plant growth through the synthesis of growth-promoting substances. The micro-organisms in biofertilizers restore the soil's natural nutrient cycle and build soil organic matter. Through the use of biofertilizers, healthy plants can be grown, while enhancing the sustainability and the health of the soil." [[1][BIOF]]

In the case study, we try to measure the difference between a biofertilizer versus a sterilized version of the same substance (control); this, in turn, indicates if the biology in the solution makes a difference to the plant's performance.

The biofertilizer evaluated in this study is very simple to manufacture at home or on-farm, requiring a jar, bucket with a lid, and a fermentation lock. Ingredients (like rice, milk, and yeast) are commonly available at a supermarket. Some optional ingredients might not be as accessible depending on the setting, like basalt rock powder, seaweed meal, and manure. The recipe is available at [https://www.gerrygillespie.net/uploads/4/5/6/5/45656863/bioferments_biostimulants_and_biofertilisers_-_making_them_on-farm_fact_sheet_final_metric_march_2019.pdf]

In the study, three local vegetable producers were tasked with setting up two separate beds with similar conditions regarding soil, sun, water, and tomato varieties. On top of that, they were instructed how to prepare the solutions, apply them, and measure BRIX readings.

The reason for measuring BRIX is that it is both easy and quick and something any grower can do themselves and will hint at plant well-being.

"The foundational idea is that the refractive index (BRIX) of plant sap correlates to the content of dissolved solids, including sugars, and can be used as an overall assessment of plant health." [[2][JKEMPF]]

Unfortunately, measuring BRIX does not tell the whole story, so soil, leaf, and fruit samples were sent to laboratories for chemical analysis.

On top of that, the report attempts to capture the experience of using the biofertilizer, using in-depth interviews to capture the hard-to-measure parts of using the solution. The interviewees include the producers mentioned above and gardeners from an urban gardening company.

### The vegetable producers

The producers in this experiment are all small-scale vegetable producer that grows ecological food on their land. They use sustainable farming practices and do not rely on heavy machinery or equipment. Instead, they rely on hand tools and natural fertilizers to grow a diverse range of vegetables on their 1000-1200 m². These producers sell most of their ecologically-grown food directly to customers and local businesses or farm stands.

They manage their lands with ideas from conservation agriculture, such as minimizing soil disturbance and maintaining permanent soil cover.

None of them considers themselves to use conventional practices.

The producers operate on the west coast of Sweden, in Kungälv, Stenungssund, and Ljungskile (20-60 km north of Gothenburg).

The case study was performed in their market gardens.

#### Timmervikens skafferi

Timmervikens skafferi operates approximately 800 square meters of beds and passages, as well as 250 square meters of greenhouses. The main fertilizer inputs used for growing are horse manure and lucern pellets, and the farm has recently increased its use of cover crops with plans to continue doing so in the future. To control caterpillars of the "large white" (Pieris brassicae), "Bacillus Thurengensis" is applied as an input. Iron sulfate pellets are used to control slugs. The farm practices no-till/no-dig management methods and actively promotes the soil microbiology.

### The gardeners

The interviewed gardeners operate from Stockholm and design, build and manage urban gardens to create habitats for insects, animals, and people.

Their clients are businesses, municipalities, and other organizations.

A number of their employees used the biofertilizer in the clients' gardens.

## Method

### Experiment setup

The three vegetable producers set up two different tomato beds to have as similar conditions as possible, w.r.t. sun, soil, and water. In both beds, the same variety of tomatoes was grown.

Two anonymous jars were given to the producers. One contained the biofertilizer, and the other was the control substance. The jars were marked to be able to keep them separated. Instructions on how to prepare, apply and measure BRIX was also distributed.

Before application, the substances were diluted at a rate of 1:150 and then applied as a foliar spray with a handheld low-pressure sprayer. Instructions mandated applications to be conducted early morning or late evening. The producers randomly selected to use one jar for one bed and the other jar for the other bed.

BRIX was measured and recorded in both beds a couple of hours after the application. The BRIX measurement was done with a digital BRIX refractometer.

The first biofertilizer application was made to the roots of the tomatoes before planting them in the garden. Then every second week throughout the growing season.

### Prepation of substances

Instructions on preparing the biofertilizer used in the experiment are available in [[5][GGR1]].

In our experiment, we used a version without any manure, as requested by the producers. Instead, we used LAB Serum, which the recipe said was a suitable replacement. Instructions on making LAB serum are also available in [[5][GGR1]].

The biofertilizer included seaweed meal (marked as optional in the recipe) and excluded rock phosphate powder (also marked as optional).

The control substance was sterilized by boiling the biofertilizer for two minutes.

The two substances were then put into six sterilized jars marked with a code (two for each grower). The code's meaning was recorded and never disclosed to the producers.

The producers where handed two jars each, one control and one experiment.

### Tests

Apart from measuring BRIX, each producer sent the following for analysis by a third-party laboratory:

- Soil analysis in early spring (before the growing season started),
- Leaf for analysis (samples were sent when fruit started ripening)
- Tomato analysis for measuring lycopene levels and vitamin C (considered to be quality indicators of tomatoes)
- Soil analysis in late autumn (after the growing season started)

Nota bene: for each analysis, one sample was taken from the experiment bed and one from the control bed and evaluated separately. Except for the first soil analysis, where only one was used.

The reports from the analyses can be found in the appendix of this report.

#### Soil analysis

To understand the effects of the inputs on soil quality, each producer conducted a soil test in the early season (May) and two additional tests in the control and experimental beds during the late season (December). The spring test reports provide a baseline measurement of the chemical composition of the soil before any inputs were applied, while the autumn test reports reveal the potential impacts of the inputs on the soil's chemical composition over the course of the growing season.

The Spurway method was used for the soil tests, which provide information on the availability of nutrients in the soil. The laboratory results were categorized as "low", "pretty low", "good", "pretty high", or "high".

#### Leaf analysis

Leaf analysis is a method of evaluating the nutrient content of plant leaves. It is often used to assess the overall health and nutritional status of a plant, as well as to diagnose nutrient deficiencies or imbalances that may be affecting plant growth and development.

Leaf analysis can be useful in identifying nutrient deficiencies that may not be apparent through other methods, such as soil testing, and can help guide the application of fertilizers or other nutrients to ensure that plants are receiving adequate nutrition.

The methodcan also be used to monitor the effectiveness of fertilization programs and to identify potential problems with plant nutrition that may be impacting crop yields.

#### Tomato analysis

Lycopene and vitamin C are important nutrients found in tomatoes and are often used as indicators of tomato quality.

Lycopene is a pigment that gives tomatoes their red color and is a powerful antioxidant. It has been linked to several health benefits, including reducing the risk of certain types of cancer[[6][MEDSCPC]] and heart disease[[7][NIHGOV1]], and may also have anti-aging and skin-protecting effects.

Vitamin C is an essential nutrient to maintain a healthy immune system and is also an antioxidant. In addition, it plays a role in the synthesis of collagen, which helps to keep skin and connective tissue strong, and may also help to reduce the risk of certain types of cancer[[8][NIHGOV2]] and heart disease[[9][NIHGOV3]].

In general, tomatoes higher in lycopene and vitamin C are considered to be of higher quality, as they may provide a greater range of health benefits to consumers.

In hindsight, testing for lycopene is not an ideal measurement for comparing tomatoes [[10][LVTOM]], since it depends on the ripeness of the tomato. However, since the tomatoes were harvested by the producers at the same time, and considered to have reached a similar level of ripeness, the results are still interesting in this study.

#### BRIX analysis

BRIX, or degrees Brix, is a measurement of sugar content in a plant. It is often used as an indicator of plant health because sugar plays a vital role in plant growth and development.

High levels of sugar can indicate that a plant is receiving sufficient nutrients and light, while low levels may suggest that the plant is experiencing stress or is not getting enough nutrients.

A small sample of plant juice was extracted (with a garlic press) from the plant and then measured with a digital refractometer.  

### Interviews with the producers and gardeners

We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with the three vegetable producers and a number of urban gardeners to capture the hard-to-measure aspects of their experiences using the biofertilizer. The interviews were conducted over the phone or via video chat and were semi-structured, allowing for flexibility and in-depth exploration of the participants' experiences.

A list of interview questions is provided in the appendix. The answers to these questions are summarized in the appendix, providing insight into the participants' thoughts and feelings about using the biofertilizer. These interviews provide valuable information that complements the findings of the experimental study, particularly concerning the more intangible aspects of using the biofertilizer.

## Result

The case study was unable to differentiate between the control and experimental beds in terms of the selected indicators in the study.

This lack of correlation between inputs (such as fertilizers, water, and other amendments) and the resulting soil analysis is not uncommon, as many factors can play in. These factors include deficiencies in water or nutrients, environmental factors such as temperature and sunlight, and the presence of adequate levels of nutrients in the soil.

Despite the lack of correlation in this case, diagrams are provided in the following section to visualize the differences between the control and experimental beds.

The reports from laboratories are included in the appendix.

#### Comments

It is hard to deduce any clear trends or tendencies from this data.

TBD: MORE HERE!!!!!!

#### Result: Leaf analysis

Unfortunately, not all producers conducted the same test or used the same laboratory, due to miscommunication. _Timmervikens skafferi_ and _Branseröds gård_ used the same test, while _Vävra Köksträdgård_ used a different one.

Despite these differences, the results were still similar enough to be considered relevant for this case study. It is important to note that the use of different tests and laboratories may affect the reliability of the results and should be taken into consideration when interpreting the data.

The results of the leaf analysis tests were categorized as "low", "pretty low", "good", "pretty high", or "high". However, for Timmervikens skafferi and Branseröd Gård, only the categories of "low", "good", and "high" were applicable. These values are shown in tables in the following section.

#### Comments on Leaf analysis

While some differences between the control and experiment beds were observed in the data, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about the impact of the inputs on tomato plants. For example, at _Branseröds gård_, the experiment bed showed more values classified as "good" compared to the control bed. However, this pattern was not consistently observed across all producers or beds.

Additionally, it is important to consider the potential influence of other factors, such as environmental conditions and soil properties, on the results. These factors could have contributed to any observed differences between the control and experiment beds, and further investigation may be necessary to understand their relative impact.

Overall, the data provides some insights into the effects of the inputs on tomato plants, but further research and analysis will likely be needed to more fully understand the impact of the input.

#### Fruit analysis

It should be stressed that one can not compare the results between the producers as these values are, among other things, dependent on variety.

To correctly measure quality of tomatoes, many more factors need to be weight in.

#### Comments on Tomato tests

The results for lycopene and vitamin C levels among the producers were mixed.

For one producer, the experiment bed had higher levels of both nutrients, while for another producer, the experiment bed had lower levels for both nutrients. The third producer showed the opposite pattern, with higher levels of vitamin C in the experiment bed but lower levels of lycopene.

Overall, the data does not support any clear conclusions about the potential effects of the inputs.

Further analysis and research may be needed to better understand the relationship between inputs and tomato quality.

Worth noting is a the levels of vitamin C in these tomatoes are 30%-230% higher compared to the "standard tomato" from _Livsmedelsverket's Livsmedelsdatabasen_ (National Food Administration, Sweden - Food database) [[11][LVLD]].

#### Results: BRIX analysis

The producers found it challenging to get consistent readings, as two samples from the same plant could produce different results. As a result, the plant juice was strained through cloth, and an average of 3-5 measurements was recorded.

#### Comments on BRIX readings

The problem of getting consistent BRIX readings, raises concerns about the reliability of these measurements presented. If a similar study is to be done in the future, one needs to find ways to increase the reliability of BRIX readings.

These result provide no strong evidence to suggest that the biofertilizer had a significant impact on the plants in this study.
