# Case study: DIY biofertilizers effects on crops

## Abstract

This report consists of two parts. The first part, referred to as "the experiment" or "the case study," attempts to measure the effects of biofertilizers in a market garden setting. The second part attempts to capture the experience of using biofertilizer.

In the experiment, we measure the performance of a simple do-it-yourself (DIY) biofertilizer, comparing it to a sterilized version (control) of the same substance in a tomato garden.

Three tomato producers set up the two beds each (with similar conditions and tomato varieties) and applied the solutions as a foliar spray every second week.

During the season, a series of tests and analyses was performed:

- soil analysis before the growing season and after the growing season ended,
- leaf analysis (once during the experiment),
- measure BRIX (once every second week),
- measure vitamin C and lycopene to indicate the fruit quality

The second part, focusing on the experience of using the solution, was conducted with in-depth interviews with the tomato producers and urban gardeners to capture their experience using the solution.

## Introduction

A biofertilizer is: "... a substance which contains living micro-organisms which, when applied to seeds, plant surfaces, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant ... add nutrients through the natural processes of nitrogen fixation, solubilizing phosphorus, and stimulating plant growth through the synthesis of growth-promoting substances. The micro-organisms in biofertilizers restore the soil's natural nutrient cycle and build soil organic matter. Through the use of biofertilizers, healthy plants can be grown, while enhancing the sustainability and the health of the soil." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofertilizer]

In the case study, we try to measure the difference between a biofertilizer versus a sterilized version of the same substance (control); this, in turn, indicates if the biology in the solution makes a difference to the plant's performance.

The biofertilizer evaluated in this study is very simple to manufacture at home or on-farm, requiring a jar, bucket with a lid, and a fermentation lock. Ingredients (like rice, milk, and yeast) are commonly available at a supermarket. Some optional ingredients might not be as accessible depending on the setting, like basalt rock powder, seaweed meal, and manure. The recipe is available at [https://www.gerrygillespie.net/uploads/4/5/6/5/45656863/bioferments_biostimulants_and_biofertilisers_-_making_them_on-farm_fact_sheet_final_metric_march_2019.pdf]

In the study, three local vegetable producers were tasked with setting up two separate beds with similar conditions regarding soil, sun, water, and tomato varieties. On top of that, they were instructed how to prepare the solutions, apply them, and measure BRIX readings.

The reason for measuring BRIX is that it is both easy and quick and something any grower can do themselves and will hint at plant well-being.

"The foundational idea is that the refractive index (BRIX) of plant sap correlates to the content of dissolved solids, including sugars, and can be used as an overall assessment of plant health."[https://johnkempf.com/the-challenges-of-managing-nutrition-with-brix-readings/]

Unfortunately, measuring BRIX does not tell the whole story, so soil, leaf, and fruit samples were sent to laboratories for chemical analysis.

On top of that, the report attempts to capture the experience of using the biofertilizer. We can use in-depth interviews to capture the hard-to-measure parts of using the solution. The interviewees include the producers mentioned above and gardeners from an urban gardening company.

### The vegetable producers

The producers in this experiment are all small-scale vegetable producer that grows ecological food on their land. They use sustainable farming practices and do not rely on heavy machinery or equipment. Instead, they rely on hand tools and natural fertilizers to grow a diverse range of vegetables on their 1000-1200 m². These producers sell most of their ecologically-grown food directly to customers and local businesses or farm stands.

They manage their lands with ideas from conservation agriculture, such as minimizing soil disturbance and maintaining permanent soil cover.

None of them considers themselves to use conventional practices.

The producers operate on the west coast of Sweden, in Kungälv, Stenungssund, and Ljungskile (20-60 km north of Gothenburg).

The case study was performed in their market gardens.

### The gardeners

The interviewed gardeners operate from Stockholm and design, build and manage urban gardens to create habitats for insects, animals, and people.

Their clients are businesses, municipalities, and other organizations.

A number of their employees used the biofertilizer in the clients' gardens.

### Sponsors of the case study

The study is made possible with the funding of `Leader Södra Bohuslän` and `Jordbruksverket`.

## Method

### Experiment setup

The three vegetable producers set up two different tomato beds to have as similar conditions as possible, w.r.t. sun, soil, and water. In both beds, the same variety of tomatoes was grown.

Two anonymous jars were given to the producers. One contained the biofertilizer, and the other was the control substance. The jars were marked to be able to keep them separated. Instructions on how to prepare, apply and measure BRIX was also distributed.

Before application, the substances were diluted at a rate of 1:150 and then applied as a foliar spray with a handheld low-pressure sprayer. Instructions mandated applications to be conducted early morning or late evening. The producers randomly selected to use one jar for one bed and the other jar for the other bed.

BRIX was measured and recorded in both beds a couple of hours after the application. The BRIX measurement was done with a digital BRIX refractometer.

The first biofertilizer application was made to the roots of the tomatoes before planting them in the garden. Then every second week throughout the growing season.

### Prepation of substances

Instructions on preparing the biofertilizer used in the experiment are available in [ref].

In our experiment, we used a version without any manure, as requested by the producers. Instead, we used LAB Serum, which the recipe said was a suitable replacement. Instructions on making LAB serum are also available in <ref>. 

The biofertilizer included seaweed meal (marked as optional in the recipe) and excluded rock phosphate powder (also marked as optional).

The control substance was sterilized by boiling the biofertilizer for two minutes.

The two substances were then put into six sterilized jars marked with a code (two for each grower). The code's meaning was recorded and never disclosed to the producers.

### Additional analysis

Apart from measuring BRIX, each producer sent the following for analysis by a third-party laboratory:

- Soil analysis in early spring (before the growing season started),
- Leaf for analysis (samples were sent when fruit started ripening)
- Fruit analysis for measuring lycopene levels and vitamin C (considered to be quality indicators of tomatoes)
- Soil analysis in late autumn (after the growing season started)

Nota bene: for each analysis, one sample was taken from the experiment bed and one from the control bed and evaluated separately. Except for the first soil analysis, where only one was used.

The reports from the analyses can be found in the appendix of this report.

### Interviews with the producers

After the growing season each grower was interviewed to be able to capture the "hard to measure"-aspects of the case study.

A set of questions (found in appendix) was used as a foundation for this interview.

The interview is open and in-depth.
