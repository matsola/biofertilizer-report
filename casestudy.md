# Case study: DIY biofertilizers effects on tomato

## Abstract

In this experiment we measure the performance of a simple, do-it-yourself (DIY), biofertilizer comparing it to a sterilized version (control) of the same substance in a tomato garden.

Three tomato growers setup the two beds each (with similar conditions and tomato variaties) and applied the solutions as a foilar spray every second week.

During the season a series of tests and analysises was performed:

- soil analysis before the growing season and after the growing season ended,
- leaf analysis (once during the experiment),
- measure BRIX (once every second week),
- measure vitamin C and lycopene to indicate the fruit quality

## Introduction

A biofertilizer is: "... a substance which contains living micro-organisms which, when applied to seeds, plant surfaces, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or the interior of the plant and promotes growth by increasing the supply or availability of primary nutrients to the host plant." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofertilizer]

In this case study, we try to measure the difference between a biofertilizer versus a sterilized version of the same substance (control); this, in turn, indicates if the biology in the solution makes a difference to the plant's performance.

The biofertilizer evaluated in this study is very simple to manufacture at home or on-farm, requiring a jar, bucket with a lid, and a fermentation lock. Ingredients (like rice, milk, and yeast) are commonly available at a supermarket. Some optional ingredients might not be as accessible depending on setting, like basalt rock powder, seaweed meal, and manure. The recipe is available at [https://www.gerrygillespie.net/uploads/4/5/6/5/45656863/bioferments_biostimulants_and_biofertilisers_-_making_them_on-farm_fact_sheet_final_metric_march_2019.pdf]

In the study, three local vegetable growers were tasked with setting up two separate beds with similar conditions regarding soil, sun, water, and tomato varieties. On top of that, they were instructed how to prepare the solutions, apply them, and measure BRIX readings.

The reason for measuring BRIX is since it is pretty easy and quick, and something any grower can do themselves. It will give you a hint of how your plant is doing.

"The foundational idea is that the refractive index (BRIX) of plant sap correlates to the content of dissolved solids, including sugars, and can be used as an overall assessment of plant health."[https://johnkempf.com/the-challenges-of-managing-nutrition-with-brix-readings/]

Unfortunately, measuring BRIX does not tell the whole story and is why soil, leaf, and fruit samples were sent to laboratories for chemical analysis.

The case study was made in Kungälv and Ljungskile in Västra Götaland, Sweden and made possible with the funding of `Leader Södra Bohuslän` and `Jordbruksverket`.

## Method

### Experiment setup

The three vegetable growers set up two different tomato beds to have as similar conditions as possible, w.r.t. sun, soil, and water. In both beds, the same variety of tomatoes was grown.

Two anonymous jars were given to the growers. One contained the biofertilizer, and the other was the control substance. The jars were marked to be able to keep them separated. Instructions on how to prepare, apply and measure BRIX was also distributed.

The substances were diluted at a rate of 1:150 and applied as a foliar spray (both on and under the leaves) with a handheld low-pressure sprayer. Instructions mandated applications should be made early morning or late evening. The growers selected to use one jar for one bed and the other jar for the other bed.

BRIX was measured in both beds simultaneously, a couple of hours later or in the coming morning after application. The BRIX measurement was done with a digital BRIX refractometer.

The first application of substances was done to the roots of the tomatoes before planting them into the garden and done throughout the growing season.

### Prepation of substances

Instructions on preparing the biofertilizer used in the experiment are found in [ref].

In our experiment, we used a version without any manure, as requested by the growers. Instead, we used LAB Serum, which the recipe mentions as a suitable replacement.

Instructions on making LAB serum are also available in [ref].

The biofertilizer included seaweed meal (marked as optional in the recipe) and excluded rock phosphate powder (also marked as optional).

The control substance was prepared by boiling the biofertilizer for two-three minutes, i.e., sterilizing it.

The control substance was prepared by boiling the biofertilizer for two minutes, i.e., sterilizing it.

The two substances were then put into six sterilized jars marked with a code (two for each grower). The code's meaning was recorded and never disclosed to the growers.

### Additional analysis

Apart from measuring BRIX, each grower sent the following for analysis by a third-party laboratory:

- Soil analysis in early spring (before the growing season started),
- Leaf for analysis (samples were sent when fruit started ripening)
- Fruit analysis for measuring lycopene levels and vitamin C (considered to be quality indicators of tomatoes)
- Soil analysis in late autumn (after the growing season started)

Nota bene: for each analysis, one sample was taken from the experiment bed and one from the control bed and evaluated separately.

The reports from the analyses can be found in the appendix of this report.

### Interviews with growers

After the growing season each grower was interviewed to be able to capture the "hard to measure"-aspects of the case study.

A set of questions (found in appendix) was used as a foundation for this interview.

The interview is open and in-depth.

## Result

SLASKHINK
In the wake of corona and the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, synthetic fertilizer prices have sky-rocketed. Before the conflict, fertilizers were also a considerable expense for many farmers and growers. Some of which could probably be made on-farm with a bit of time and effort from the grower. 

In later years, with the regenerative agriculture movement, farmers have shifted their use of synthetic fertilizers for more natural ways of growing food. They are trying to mimic nature and tap into the powers of biology in, on, and around plants. Soil biology and soil health are pivotal concepts in regenerative agriculture, and a whole market of different living amendments has shown up.
