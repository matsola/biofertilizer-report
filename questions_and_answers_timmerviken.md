# Questions and answers from Timmervikens skafferi

## Application of biofertilizer

* Did you see any differences with regards to growth, vigor, taste, diseases?
  * Not really - nothing striking. However, one of the beds [the experiment bed - Ed.] performed better than the other, but that could just as well have resulted from its location (more sun). There were beans in similar locations, and the beans with more sun performed better.

    The better-performing bed yield was 12240g of tomatoes, compared to 11040g for the other.

* Any other differences?
  * The better-performing bed was in a water-sick spot, which might have impacted the plants negatively.

* Describe your experiences from applications of the substance
  * Experienced no problems applying the substances. A checklist that included all steps to prepare the substances, measure BRIX, and so on were used to ensure everything was as consistent as possible.
* Did you understand which one was control and not?
  * The jars were given as little attention as possible to avoid unconsciously compromising the experiment. However, one jar was suspicious since something was happening inside it.
* What type of inputs do you use?
  * Horse manure, lucern pellets, potassium magnesia and epsom salt.
* Did you adjust other inputs as a consequence of the use of the biofertilizer?
  * The inputs were used in all beds, with no exception for the experiment beds [as instructed by the experiment setup - Ed.]. It was the first year using the inputs, and their instructions were followed without exceptions.  
* Anything else you wish to bring forward when it comes to the substance?
  * It feels nice to use bio-active amendments!

## Measuring BRIX

* What are your thoughts on measuring BRIX?
  * Before the experiment started, it was inspiring to measure BRIX. A simple tool to use everywhere in the garden. However, as the experiment progressed, it became evident that measuring BRIX was not very precise. Doing multiple readings from the same plant gave readings with a significant deviation. This observation took the relevance and the fun out of it.

* Did you measure any differences between the two beds?
  * No
* Did it provide yourself with any valuable insights?
  * No
* Have you previously measured BRIX?
  * No
* Will you continue to measure BRIX?
  * Wants to continue but needs to find a way to get consistent readings.
  
## Soil analysis

* Anything that suprised you from the soil analysis results?
  * Not really. Has done multiple soil tests in the previous seasons; however, those were of a different type and does not provide comparable results.
* Will you change your process/inputs/etc as a result of the soil analysis?
  * Maybe. It gives some indication on what amendments to use.
* Will you do more soil analysis in the future?
  * Yes, probably. Even if the tests do not say that much, they say something. It is interesting to see how the readings change between seasons.
  
## Leaf analysis

* Anything that suprised you from the leaf analysis results?
  * Hard to say as it is hard to interpret the test results. If there would have been significant differences between the beds, then it would have been interesting to investigate why. However, the results were very similar.
* Will you change your process/inputs/etc as a result of the leaf analysis?
  * No
* Will you do more leaf analysis in the future?
  * Uncertain

## Crop analysis

* Anything that suprised you from the crop analysis results?
  * These tests felt exciting, especially from a marketing perspective, but at the same time hard to interpret.
* Will you do more crop analysis in the future?
  * Probably not.

## Other

* Anything else you wish to bring up?
  * Unfortunately, it was a bad tomato season and none of the beds reached expectations (also those not included in the case study).
  * It feels good to working actively with microorganisms.
